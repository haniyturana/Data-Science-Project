# Data Science (Python)

This repository showcases my projects from my **Data Science class**, focusing exclusively on **Python**.

###  Why Python?
While I acknowledge that **R** is often the superior tool for **Time Series Forecasting** and statistical modeling, I find **Python** to be more versatile for the broader scope of Data Science—particularly in **Classification Analysis, NLP, and Deep Learning**.

### What's Inside
- **Python-based projects:** Focusing on Machine Learning (Classification) and NLP.
- **Data Analysis:** Using Pandas & Scikit-Learn.

### My Broader Portfolio
